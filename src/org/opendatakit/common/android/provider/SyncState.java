 * The contents of the SYNC_STATE column. The state of the table with regards

 * NB: Lowercase due to considerations regarding javascript.

 * <p>
 * Here is a brief overview of the rules for transitions between states on basic
 * write operations:
 *
 * <pre>
 * insert:
 *     state = INSERTING
 *
 * update:
 *     if state == REST:
 *        state = UPDATING
 *
 * delete:
 *     if state == REST or state == UPDATING:
 *        state = DELETING
 *        don't actually delete yet (defer until synched)
 *     else if state == INSERTING:
 *        actually delete
 * </pre>
